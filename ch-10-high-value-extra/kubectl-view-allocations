kubectl-view-allocations

kubectl plugin lists allocations for resources (cpu, memory, gpu,...) as defined into the manifest of nodes and running pods. 
It doesn't list usage like kubectl top. It can provide result grouped by namespaces, nodes, pods and filtered by resources'name.

Installation:

Run the script 

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidB/kubectl-view-allocations/master/scripts/getLatest.sh | bash

Usage:

kubectl-view-allocations -h

kubectl-view-allocations #simplest view of resources

kubectl-view-allocations -u #see cpu & memory utilization

kubectl-view-allocations -r cpu #only cpu resource usage

kubectl-view-allocations -r memory #only memory resource usage

kubectl-view-allocations -g node #node specific usage of memory/cpu
