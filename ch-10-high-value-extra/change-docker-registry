Either pass the --registry-mirror option when starting dockerd manually, 
or edit /etc/docker/daemon.json (file need to be created) and add the 
registry-mirrors key and value, to make the change persistent.


{
  "registry-mirrors": ["https://<my-docker-mirror-host>"]
}

Save the file and reload Docker for the change to take effect.
